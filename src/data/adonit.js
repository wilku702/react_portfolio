  description: `At Adonit, I contributed to both mobile and data projects. I built new features for the Adonit One app in React Native, including an audio module with AI-powered key point generation and accessibility support. In parallel, I developed a web application using Python, Streamlit, and SQL to extract data from BigQuery, applying Facebook’s Prophet model for predictive analytics and product revenue forecasting. I also authored YAML configuration files to streamline updates and enable feature integration via GitLab CI/CD pipelines.`,
